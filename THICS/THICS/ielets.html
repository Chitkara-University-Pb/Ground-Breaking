IELTS is jointly managed by University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations (Cambridge ESOL), British Council and IDP. IELTS conforms to the highest international standards of language assessment. It covers the four language skills- listening, writing, reading and speaking. IELTS is recognized by universities and employers in many countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. It is also recognized by professional bodies, immigration authorities and other government agencies.
